<h2>Developing two-, three- and n-dimensional complex number spherical coordinate systems from first principles</h2>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
Angle-dependent rotation factors have been introduced to describe position vector rotation in a plane. A fundamental equation of position vector rotation has been discovered with an orthogonal rotation factor directly appearing in the equation. The solution to the fundamental equation leads to a rotation factor formula for all rotation angles. Based on rotation factors with the imaginary unit being bypassed, the two-dimensional complex number system has been developed with results showing that a new independent derivation of Eulerâ€™s formula is achieved and that the orthogonal rotation factor is equivalent to the imaginary unit. The concept of rotation factors for rotating position vectors and numbers with positioning directions is extended to other dimensions, and the constructions of three and higher n-dimensional complex number spherical coordinate systems have been realized. The rotation factors are shown to be commutative in the spherical systems. The obtained spherical systemâ€™s coordinate formula is succinct and consistent across dimensions with one rotation factor for each dimension, indicating that the rotation factors are natively fit for the spherical systems.
